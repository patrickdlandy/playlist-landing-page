            <br>
            <p class="subtitle">Music is a powerful way to bond with people. Comparing our tastes in music continues to be an important part of my friendship with you, Shiva. I hope that this little experiment can help me get to know you a bit more as well, Emily!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subtitle">I put this playlist together for the two of you to enjoy after the bustle of the wedding activites dies down a bit. It's for when you get a chance to sit down together on a beach or just chill in your living room on a weeknight and put some jams on.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subtitle">I sourced these artists and songs from my memories with you, Shiva, as well as from your descriptions of Emily's taste and vibe. I got input from the Bachelor party crew and put in a few of my own personal recommendations as well. I had a lot of fun making this and figuring out how to transition between dance pop, country, rock, and R&B.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="subtitle">Enjoy! I'm excited for more opporunities to turn up the jams with both of you. Congratulations.</p>
